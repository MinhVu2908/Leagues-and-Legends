# Leagues-and-Legends (arena)

Minimal scaffold to keep `arena` organized and scalable.

Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # starts dev server (Vite) serving the `arena` folder
npm run build  # builds the `arena` site to `dist`
```

Structure

- arena/
  - index.html        # entry (loads JS/CSS from `src`)
  - src/
    - js/main.js      # application logic
    - css/styles.css  # styles

Next steps

- Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to preview locally.
- Add tests and linting when ready.
